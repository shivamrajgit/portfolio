                The things I'm taught at college and the pace to me, feels sluggish in comparision to the world today. I'm always eager to learn more about things i have my interests on. So here I am learning things and applying it all as I move ahead.

            <h2 class="about-head">why web development and ML ?</h2>
            <p class="about-content">
                My love for aesthetically pleasing and beautiful things makes me explore web development
                 and at the same time this whole "AI" trend makes me curious to learn it myself.
                 The thing is i keep exploring different tech stacks to know most of them inside out and choose what's best for me.

                I enjoy gaming and reading novels in my leisure time. Also like everyone else, I also find myself binging on animes or series on week days.
